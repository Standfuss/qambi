Most examples rely on the assets in the assets folder.

Because the assets are quite large in file size they are not added this repository.

Originally the assets were stored in a separate repository and included as a submodule in heartbeat, but the assets repository grew over 1GB which is not allowed on both GitHub and Bitbucket.

Therefor the assets can be downloaded as a separate archive from the heartbeat server. Note that the version number of the assets archive might change per commit; please make sure that you have downloaded the right version for your current git checkout. You can find a file with name of the version you should use in the assets folder (for instance: assets.v1). This file contains the download link.

After downloading upzip the archive in the /assets folder.

Dependent on the version of the assets, you should get a directory structure that looks somewhat like this:

/assets
    /city-piano
    /examples
    /ir
    /midi
    /patcharena
    /sso
        /brass
        /etcetera
/build
/examples
/fonts
/src
/tools
